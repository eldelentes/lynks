# lynks

Lynks is a very hacky, simple and lightweight script for made link agregator using only jQuery and a text document as CMS (In this case Google Doc document)

I opened this project because I want that everyone can make their own Lynk page and improve the code, design or anything that can be tweaked.

This is a humble project, don't be rude with me, I'm a simple designer triying to do things.
